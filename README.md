##Codes for "Flocking by stopping -- a novel mechanism of consensus in collective movement"

###Codes
1. A Python code ('Nullclines.py') to calculate and plot the nullclines of the ordinary differential equations of the pairwise stop model.
   The output is a nullcline plot in the polarization(m) vs speed(v) grid, in Figure 2 of the manuscript
2. A Python code ('SDE_Simulation.py') to perform numerical integration of the stochastic differential equation of the pairwise stop model.
   The output is a time series of the group polarization and average speed, in the Appendix Figure of the manuscript
3. A Python code ('Gillespie_Simulation.py') to perform numerical simulation of the discrete pairwise stop model.
   The output is a time series of the group polarization and average speed, in the Appendix Figure of the manuscript
4. A Python code ('Bifurcation.py') to plot a bifurcation diagram of the ordinary differential equations of the pairwise stop model.
   The output is a bifurcation plot for group polarization and average group speed.
